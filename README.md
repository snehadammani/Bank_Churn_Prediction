Got it! You want a **professional, standard README** for your GitHub project without emojis. I’ll provide a template for your **Bank Churn Prediction** project. You can create a file named `README.md` in your project folder and paste the following:

# Bank Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is a **Bank Churn Prediction Application** that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a bank (churn) using a machine learning model. The app also provides visualizations to understand customer behavior and banking patterns.

## Features
- Predict customer churn based on input features.
- Display prediction probabilities.
- Visualize customer data through charts:
  - Customers by Card Category.
  - Credit Limit by Income Category.
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains customer information including:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Education Level, Marital Status, Income Category)
- Account and transaction data (Months on Book, Total Relationship Count, Credit Limit, Total Transaction Amount, etc.)
- Target variable: `Churn` or `Card_Category`

## Machine Learning Model
- Model used: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Trained using scikit-learn
- Model saved as `random_forest_model.pkl`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/snehadammani/bank-churn-prediction.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd "bank prediction customer analysis"
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

* Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure `requirements.txt` includes all required libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

* Use the sidebar to enter customer details.
* View predicted churn and probabilities.
* Explore visualizations on the dashboard.

If you want, I can **also create a `requirements.txt` file** for your project so anyone cloning the repo can install all dependencies easily and run your app without errors.  

Do you want me to do that?
